info: After more than two years of collaboration we're very happy to announce this release by our Friends from the Zurich; Corusa and Miguel Lautaro. This EP is more than just outstanding, it refines the basic idea behind Melodic Techno. With "Sensitivity", the first track of the EP, they created a perfect mix of melancholy, interchanging synthetic melodies, percussions and trancy breaks. Furthermore with "Tension of Time" a real bomb has been created; pumping baselines, soft synth melodies meeting a perfect drum line - an essential tune for the dancefloor. With Avior's remix of "Tension of Time" we'll include a re-interpretation of Corusa & Miguel Lautaro's idea behind the original track, following their initial thoughts but curated with even more experimental melodies.
